1. This app (while idle) does NOT collect any sensitive information, and does NOT use network (exception is the "News" page, it uses network to load the launcher news)
2. While running Minecraft, app also does NOT collect any sensitive information about your device. Snooper by Mojang does.
3. Some sensitive data is stored in crash reports after the game crashes, but it's not being shared to anyone except the current user.
